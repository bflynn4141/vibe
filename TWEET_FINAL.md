## What We Built

- **Ralph Wiggum**: Autonomous coordinator for /vibe maintenance
- **8 Specialist Agents**: Each handles their domain (@ops, @bridges, @curator, etc.)
- **AIRC Protocol**: Ed25519 signed handoffs between agents
- **GitHub Actions**: Runs nightly at 2am PT
- **Smart Routing**: Tasks automatically go to the right specialist
- **Git Attribution**: Commits show which agent did what

## What We Did NOT Build (Yet)

- ❌ Spirit Protocol integration
- ❌ Cross-repo coordination (Eden, contracts, etc.)
- ❌ Spirit ecosystem-wide agents

This is **pure /vibe** — agents maintaining /vibe itself.

(Cross-ecosystem coordination is future vision, not today's ship)
